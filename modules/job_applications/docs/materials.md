# Application Materials Guide

## Purpose

Draft cover letters and application emails that are tailored to the specific job and company. These are drafts for the user to review and modify - they should be high quality but the user will personalize them before sending.

## When to Draft What

### Cover Letter
Draft a full cover letter when:
- The application is via email and a cover letter is expected/mentioned
- The application portal requests a cover letter upload
- The role is senior or specialized where cover letters are standard

### Application Email
Draft an email when:
- The application method is via email
- A cover letter will be attached, but you need email body text
- The situation calls for brief, professional correspondence

### Both
Sometimes you'll need both:
- Full cover letter attached
- Brief email that introduces the attached materials

## Cover Letter Structure

### Opening Paragraph
- State the position you're applying for
- Brief mention of where you saw the posting (if relevant)
- One sentence hook about why you're interested or qualified

### Middle Paragraphs (2-3)
- Connect your experience to their requirements
- Reference specific aspects of your background that match their needs
- Incorporate company research where relevant (recent news, their products, their approach)
- Show genuine interest in what they do

### Closing Paragraph
- Reaffirm interest
- Mention availability for interview
- Professional close

### Length
- Aim for 250-400 words
- One page when formatted
- Three to four paragraphs typically

## Application Email Structure

### Subject Line
- Clear and professional
- Include position title and your name
- Follow any instructions from the posting

### Email Body (if cover letter is attached)
- Brief greeting
- One sentence about the position
- Note what's attached
- Thank them for consideration
- Professional close

### Email Body (if no separate cover letter)
- Functions as a short cover letter
- 150-250 words
- Hit key points concisely
- Reference attached CV

## Tone and Style

### Professional but Personable
- Clear and direct
- Enthusiastic without being over-the-top
- Confident without arrogance
- Specific rather than generic

### Show, Don't Just Tell
- "I used Python and SQL to analyze customer behavior patterns" not "I have strong analytical skills"
- "I'm excited about your new analytics platform launch" not "I'm passionate about data"

### Avoid
- Clichés ("I'm a team player", "I think outside the box")
- Excessive flattery or generic praise
- Repeating the CV word-for-word
- Being overly formal or stiff
- Jokes or excessive casualness (unless the company culture clearly supports it)

## Using Company Research

Incorporate research naturally:
- "I noticed your recent expansion into the healthcare sector and..."
- "Your engineering blog's posts about data pipeline optimization align with..."
- "Given your use of Python and PostgreSQL for analytics..."

Don't force it if it feels awkward. Brief mentions are better than lengthy passages about the company.

## Using Keywords

Naturally incorporate relevant keywords from the job description:
- If they emphasize "stakeholder communication," mention your experience communicating with stakeholders
- If they mention specific tools, reference your experience with those tools
- Don't keyword-stuff - make it read naturally

## Output Format

## Quality Guidelines

**Good drafts:**
- Are specific to this job and company
- Connect user's experience to job requirements
- Show genuine interest through concrete details
- Use clear, professional language
- Are the appropriate length for the context
- Reference company research where it fits naturally

**Poor drafts:**
- Could work for any similar job (too generic)
- Simply restate the CV
- Are overly long or short
- Use clichéd phrases
- Don't show understanding of the role or company
- Feel forced or awkward

## Examples

### Opening - Generic (Poor)
"I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position. I am a passionate and dedicated professional with strong analytical skills."

### Opening - Specific (Good)
"I'm applying for the Senior Data Analyst position at DataCorp. Your recent launch of the ClearView analytics platform and expansion of the data team aligns perfectly with my five years of experience building customer analytics systems in Python and SQL."

### Middle - Generic (Poor)
"I have excellent technical skills and am proficient in many tools. I work well in teams and can communicate effectively with stakeholders."

### Middle - Specific (Good)
"In my current role at TechStart, I developed automated reporting dashboards using Python and Tableau that reduced manual reporting time by 60%. This involved regular collaboration with product managers and executives to understand their analytics needs - similar to the stakeholder-facing aspects mentioned in your job description."

## Personalization Notes for User

Always include a section reminding the user to:
- Add any personal touches or anecdotes
- Verify all claims match their experience accurately
- Adjust tone if they have a better sense of company culture
- Customize the greeting if they have a contact name
- Proofread for any errors or awkward phrasing

## Remember

These are high-quality drafts, not final products. The user will review, modify, and personalize them. Your job is to give them a strong starting point that's already well-tailored to the specific opportunity.
