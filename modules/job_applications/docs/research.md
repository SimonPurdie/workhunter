# Company Research Guide

## Purpose

Gather relevant context about the company to inform the application. Good research helps tailor application materials and prepares the user for potential interviews.

## What to Research

### Essential Information
- **Company overview** - What they do, their products/services, industry sector
- **Size and structure** - Employee count, locations, organizational structure if available
- **Recent developments** - News from the past 6-12 months (funding, acquisitions, product launches, expansions)

### Valuable Context
- **Tech stack** - Technologies and tools they use (if mentioned anywhere)
- **Team structure** - Size of the relevant team/department if discoverable
- **Company culture** - Values, working style, any information about their culture (but avoid generic PR speak)
- **Growth trajectory** - Are they expanding, stable, or contracting?

### Application-Relevant Details
- **Why this matters for applications** - Note anything that would be particularly relevant to mention in a cover letter
- **Keywords** - Terms that appear frequently in their communications (for ATS optimization)
- **Specific projects or initiatives** - Concrete things they're working on that the role might involve

## Where to Look

Use web_search to find:
1. **Company website** - About page, careers page, blog, product pages
2. **LinkedIn** - Company page for size/structure, recent posts for culture/news
3. **Recent news** - Search for "[company name] news" to find recent articles
4. **Tech/industry publications** - For tech stack info, product announcements
5. **Company social media** - Sometimes reveals culture and current initiatives

Use web_fetch to read full pages when search snippets aren't sufficient.

## What to Avoid

- Don't just copy generic mission statements from their website
- Avoid speculation about company health or practices
- Don't include information that's clearly outdated (check dates)
- Skip information that's not relevant to the application (e.g., unrelated business units)

## Output Format

Structure your research as markdown with clear sections:

```markdown

## Quality Guidelines

**Good research:**
- Provides specific, concrete details
- Notes dates for time-sensitive information
- Distinguishes between facts and observations
- Includes source URLs for verification
- Highlights information directly relevant to the application

**Poor research:**
- Generic statements that could apply to any company
- Outdated information without date context
- Speculation presented as fact
- Bulk copying from company website without synthesis
- Information overload without highlighting what matters

## Example of Good vs Poor

**Poor:** "TechCorp values innovation and believes in empowering their employees to do their best work."

**Good:** "TechCorp launched a new analytics platform in Q3 2025 and announced they're expanding their data team by 40% to support it. Their engineering blog shows they use Python, PostgreSQL, and dbt for their data pipeline."

The second example is specific, recent, and directly relevant to a data analyst application.
